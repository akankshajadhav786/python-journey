# Python Journey 🐍

This repository documents my journey of learning Python from scratch.

I am starting with the basics and gradually moving towards building small projects.
The goal of this repository is to stay consistent, learn by doing, and track my progress publicly.

## 📌 Current Progress
- Day 1: Python basics
  - Printing statements
  - Strings and concatenation
  - Input function
  - Variables and `len()`
  - Swapping variables
  - Mini project: Band Name Generator

## 🛠 Tools & Language
- Python 3
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How I’m learning
- Following structured courses (e.g. Angela Yu – 100 Days of Python)
- Writing code daily
- Uploading progress day by day

More updates coming soon.
